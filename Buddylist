===== INFODESK PROJECT ============
The Infodesk project is a network of netcitizens who have aspired to be the connecting dots for newcoming jtorchat users. They will essentially be the living addressbook for the torchat network, helping to connect people together.

There is one for every region on earth.

tl;dr: Infodesk operators are living address books
